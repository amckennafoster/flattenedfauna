Wife Vicki called me, than 911 for help at about 9am, to report the deer suffering in front of our living room window. I was at work. 
911 operator indicated LE or F&G would do nothing, it is on our property, it is our responsibility. Vicki called me again, and I left work She indicated it had quit struggling. When I arrived it was dead. It appeared to have been hit by a automobile. No vehicle was present.
 I pulled it into my pickup and went back to work. I dressed/processed the deer after work.
