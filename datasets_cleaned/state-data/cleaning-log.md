Removed observations that do not include Latitude Longitude data. It would be possible to extrapolate latitude and longitude from highways, mile markers, but the choice was made to eliminate this data. 

Removed observations where the animal was living, eg. “mother and young one crossing the road.”

Removed observations that did not identify an animal.
